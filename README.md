Work in progress. Published early due to being a dependent of a school project.

Kinda missing the CRDT part itself. Right now, it has MapTree/MapDiff and ObjectTree/ObjectDiff packages. Currently it purely acts as a differentiation algorithm between two trees, generating a list of operations required to transform the first tree into the second. Used for simple replication purposes.
